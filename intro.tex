\section{Introduction}

This document describes the NDN naming conventions that gradually evolved during the past years of NDN application development practice. The aim of this document is to provide a general guideline for NDN application developers to properly design their application namespaces. The conventions described here are \textsc{recommendations} at most: it is up to the application developers to decide whether to follow these conventions or to override them with their own definitions. However, following well-established conventions allows to design and build applications that are most efficient for routing infrastructure to handle, less painful to debug, best understandable to end-users and most compatible with other applications that follow the same conventions.

The conventions developed in this document are largely inspired by the CCNx Basic Naming Conventions specification as described in \url{http://www.ccnx.org/releases/latest/doc/technical/NameConventions.html}. We added several changes to reflect our current understanding about the naming conventions based on the experience from application development.
